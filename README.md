Stock Market Predictor Using Machine Learning & News Sentiment Analysis

This code features a predictive model for the S&P 500 index. 
This was made possible by leveraging machine learning techniques and using historical stock data to achieve an accuracy rate of 56%.

Furthermore, there is an implementation of a text analysis function to categorize real-time news data from Yahoo Finance 
as ‘bullish’ or ‘bearish’, integrating market sentiment on inflation and interest rates into the model, 
thereby enhancing the accuracy of S&P 500 index predictions.


To allow for continous improvements on the Machine Learning Model, an effective back testing strategy was implemented to 
assess model performance over time.
